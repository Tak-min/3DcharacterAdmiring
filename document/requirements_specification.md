# Requirements Specification: 3D Character Observation Web App

## 1. Project Overview
A web application that enables users to interact with a 3D character via voice or text, with the character responding through speech and animations. Features include a currency system, shop, user authentication, and dynamic character parameters.

## 2. Functional Requirements

### 2.1 User Interaction (MCP)
-   **User Authentication**:
    -   Users must register and log in to access the main application.
    -   Implement a simple email-based two-factor authentication (2FA) for secure login.
-   **Text Input**:
    -   Users can interact via a text input field on the home screen.
-   **3D Character Display**:
    -   A 3D character model must be rendered on the home screen upon successful login.
    -   The character can be in a default pose (e.g., T-pose) initially.
-   **Basic UI Navigation**:
    -   A hamburger menu icon in the top-right corner reveals a sidebar.
    -   The sidebar contains a button to navigate to the options screen.
-   **Options Screen**:
    -   The `option.html` page provides a single function: a "Logout" button.

### 2.2 Advanced Features (Future Scope)
-   **Voice Input**:
    -   Users can interact via voice input using a microphone and the AssemblyAI Speech-to-Text API.
-   **Character Animations**:
    -   Characters perform animations (e.g., blushing, laughing, anger) based on user inputs.
    -   Animations are triggered by clicking/tapping specific 3D model areas.
-   **Input Evaluation**:
    -   AI evaluates user inputs using sentiment analysis via **Gemini 2.0 Flash (primary) or Gemini 1.5 Flash (fallback)**.
    -   Assigns in-game currency and character affinity points based on evaluation.
-   **Voice Responses**:
    -   Generate voice responses for the character using the **ElevenLabs API** for high-quality, character-rich voice synthesis.

## 2.5 Technical Requirements
-   **Frontend**:
    -   HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
    -   Use Three.js for 3D rendering and animations.
    -   Responsive design for desktop and mobile (min resolution: 320x568px).
-   **Backend**:
    -   Flask (Python) for API endpoints and business logic.
    -   SQLite database (switch to PostgreSQL for production).
    -   WebSocket support for real-time interactions.
-   **APIs**:
    -   **Language Model**: **Gemini 2.0 Flash (primary), Gemini 1.5 Flash (fallback)** for text generation and sentiment analysis.
    -   **Text-to-Speech**: **ElevenLabs TTS API** for high-quality, expressive voice generation.
    -   **Speech-to-Text**: AssemblyAI (real-time transcription, <500ms latency).
-   **Deployment**:
    -   Deployable on local servers or cloud platforms (e.g., Heroku, AWS).
    -   Provide Docker configuration for consistent environments.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements
-   **Performance**:
    -   Voice response latency: <500ms using **Gemini 2.0 Flash**.
    -   3D rendering: 60 FPS on mid-range devices.
    -   Page load time: <2 seconds.
-   **Scalability**:
    -   Support up to 1,000 concurrent users with PostgreSQL.
    -   API rate limit handling with retry mechanisms for **Gemini 2.0 Flash**.
-   **Accessibility**:
    -   Follow WCAG 2.1 guidelines.
-   **Security**:
    -   HTTPS for all communications.
    -   Secure storage of user credentials (hashed passwords with bcrypt).
    -   **Gemini 2.0 Flash** and other API keys stored in environment variables.
-   **Reliability**:
    -   99.9% uptime for production.
    -   Graceful degradation for **Gemini 2.0 Flash** API failures (e.g., switch to Gemini 1.5 Flash, cached responses).
